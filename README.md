# Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-using-Scikit-learn
This is a file from where you can learn how to use the scikit learn package. And can learn how to implement logistic regression and various classification using Python.
I have used the digits dataset from scikit-learn. You can use any dataset which you have.
Then I have trained the model with 70% training data and tested it in 30% testing data.
After that I have splitted the model again and have used with 80% training data and 20% testing data.
And then I have trained and tested in 75% training data and 25% testing data.
After that I have created a confusion matrix using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
And then I have found the accuracy.
Hope you like the code and Please let me know if you are stuck in between.
